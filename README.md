# Get Coding with CERN@school!

Welcome to the CERN@school "Get Coding!" course. Click on the
lesson link below to open up the corresponding
Jupyter Notebook in your browser.
Alternatively, clone the repository (and/or fork it)
to your local machine to go through everything
interactively.

* [Lesson 1](./01_lesson1.ipynb).


## Disclaimers
* _This code dates from 2016. While every attempt has been
made to ensure that it is usable, some work may be required to get it
running on your own particular system.
We recommend using a GridPP CernVM; please refer to
[this guide](http://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.4552825.v1)
for further instructions.
Unfortunately CERN@school cannot guarantee further support for this code.
Please proceed at your own risk_.
* _This repository is now deprecated, and remains here for legacy purposes.
For future work regarding CERN@school, please refer to the
[Institute for Research in Schools](http://researchinschools.org) (IRIS)
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/InstituteForResearchInSchools).
Please also feel free to fork and modify this code as required for
your own research._


## The data
The data used in the lesson is taken from the
[Crookes dataset](http://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.734262.v1),
a sample set of measurements made at the Royal Institution of
Great Britain during the BIG SCIENCE event of 18th June 2013.

## Changing or adding more lessons
That said, if you're feeling inspired, please feel free to
fork this repository, alter the content, and add more lessons - this
is only the beginning of what you can do with CERN@school!

## Acknowledgements
First of all, a huge thanks to all of the contributors
to this course - whether via this repository, email,
or offline - your feedback is very much appreciated!

There are many coding courses available online for
Python and, indeed, many other languages.
This course is focussed on coding in the context
of scientific research with CERN@school,
and so mainly works with examples based on
CERN@school data and analysis.
However, material and feedback from the
[RAL Scientific Computing Department](http://www.scd.stfc.ac.uk/SCD/)'s
Python Masterclass
and
[Codecademy's Python course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/python)
has been particularly useful - thanks!

_CERN@school was supported by
the UK [Science and Technology Facilities Council](http://www.stfc.ac.uk) (STFC)
via grant numbers ST/J000256/1 and ST/N00101X/1,
as well as a Special Award from the Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851._
