## Acknowledgements
First of all, a huge thanks to all of the contributors
to this course - whether via this repository, email,
or offline - your feedback is very much appreciated!

There are many coding courses available online for
Python and, indeed, many other languages.
This course is focussed on coding in the context
of scientific research with CERN@school,
and so mainly works with examples based on
CERN@school data and analysis.
However, material and feedback from the
[RAL Scientific Computing Department](http://www.scd.stfc.ac.uk/SCD/)'s
Python Masterclass
and
[Codecademy's Python course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/python)
has been particularly useful - thanks!

The development of this course is supported by
[STFC](http://www.stfc.ac.uk)
grant number ST/N00101X/1.
